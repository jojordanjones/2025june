# Life OS 2025

This experimental Next.js app turns the 7k-word context dump into a searchable knowledge base with a native iPadOS feel. Run `npm run build-context` to convert `everything.md` into `data/context.json`.

Routes:
- `/` – main dashboard with hero, vision, action plan and knowledge base
- `/dashboards` – full screen analytics
- `/systems` – templates gallery
- `/planner` – offline planner (stub)

## Development

```
npm install
npm run dev
```
